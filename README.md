# HDL-Lab3-Fitbit
Your objective in this lab is to develop a simplified version of the activity tracking device, Fitbit, on an FPGA. The Fitbit will implement a subset of features offered by the real Fitbit device and app. A circuit that would provide input pulses to your Fitbit module will also be synthesized and implemented in this lab.
